5 topics I find interesting in relation to computers:

1.) The ability to express creativity when it comes to creating new projects and ideas 
that can improve our day to day life or make work more efficient.

2.) Writing programs that allow us to handle big data. I work at a biotech company and we 
have sequencers that generate 8 TB of data per run. The pipelines align the DNA sequencing data
to a reference genome, and performs different analysis.

3.) The evolution of programming languages. Not only have technology evolved but the languages 
used to build these have also evolve to address challenges and changing needs of programmers.

4.) Diversity of programming applications. Even at a biotech company, we utilize code for a number of
applications including programming automating liquid handlers to perform complex lab workflows,
creating pipelines that handle big data, and using code to graph and visualize data (ie RStudio).

5.) The emergence of Artifical Intellence and how that impacts jobs. AI will be able to automate
and optimize many tasks. What jobs would be replace by automation and AI in the future and what new 
jobs will emerge due to AI. Although AI may make some jobs obsolete, it also can create new job roles.

5 topics I find challenging in relation to computers:

1.) Not just writing working code but efficient code that optimizes execution time and resources,
like CPU and memory.

2.) The challenge shifting from logicial linear programming to object oriented programming.
I feel comfortable writing simple classes, but I'm still learning writing more complex programs
that may have multiple classes and objects with different relations to each other.

3.) Anything that is 'intelligent' can be hacked. That includes phones, laptops, and even everyday
house hold items that are 'smart'. Like alexa/google, or a smart fridge.

4.) The growing computing power and intelligence of AI. Although AI is exciting, there are social
and ethical concerns. Humans have been the most intelligent species so far. What happens when we 
aren't anymore and we can't control AI or the actions of AI become incomprehensible because we 
aren't intelligent enough to understand it?

5.) Cyber security in the work place. Hackers constantly evolve thier methods as the technology and
cyber security changes. At work some measures we have in place include cyber security trainings
to spot suspicious links and emails, changing passwords regularly, and using a security platform.
